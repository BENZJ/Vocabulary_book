In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada ,Miranda Priestly,played by Meryl Streep, (scolds)[责骂] her unattractive assistant (for imagining )[认为]that high fashion doesn’t affect her ,Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant’s sweater descended over the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the (bargain bin) [折价商品]in which the poor girl doubtless found her (garment)[衣服].

This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn’t be more out of date or at odds with the feverish world described in Overdressed . Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of “fast fashion”. In the last decade or so ,advances in technology have allowed mass-market labels such as Zara ,H&M,and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly and anticipate demand more precisely. Quicker turnarounds mean less wasted inventory , more frequent releases ,and more profit . This labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable—meant to last only a wash or two ,although they don’t advertise that —and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks . By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices , Cline argues ,these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.
